# Samuel Frappier-Fortin

systems-oriented student with interests in:  
**game engines, micro-architecture, real-time systems, and embedded software**.

I enjoy working close to the hardware, reasoning about performance and memory,
and designing systems that behave **predictably under constraints**.
I’m open-minded across domains and motivated by learning through building.

## Focus Areas

- Systems-level C++ design and architecture
- Engine-level and tooling-oriented code
- Embedded and hardware-adjacent software

---

## Featured Projects

- **[Simple Compiler](link)**  
  Compiler project exploring parsing, internal representations,
  and code generation, with an emphasis on clarity and correctness.

- **[Low-Level & Assembly Notes](link)**  
  Personal documentation formalizing low-level concepts, assembly,
  and calling conventions to build strong mental models.  
  Used to help teach low-level concepts to other students.

## In Progress

- **Navigable Black Hole Simulation (C++ / OpenGL)**  
  Exploratory project focused on multithreaded physics computation
  and practical use of the OpenGL API.  
  Emphasis on concurrency, data flow, and clean separation between
  simulation and rendering.

- **Wind Tunnel Embedded System**  
  Real-time embedded project involving hardware interfacing, sensor data,
  and validation under real-world constraints.  
  Used in the context of a master’s thesis at UQAR.
