## Samuel Frappier-Fortin

Systems-oriented developer focused on **game engines, real-time systems, and embedded software**.  
Primary interests are **performance, memory behavior, and deterministic execution**.  
I learn by **building complete systems end-to-end** and validating them under real constraints.

### Core Focus

- C++ design and low-level architecture
- Engine-level systems and tooling
- Embedded and hardware-adjacent software
- Concurrency, data flow, and timing guarantees

---

### Featured Projects

- **[Minimal Compiler](https://github.com/DriftCastSam/Compiler)**  
  An x86-32 compiler implementing Ghuloum's incremental approach for a Scheme-like language with arithmetic, variables, conditionals, and heap allocation.  
  Features dual evaluation modes: Runtime Evaluation (RTE) generates full assembly, while Compile-Time Evaluation (CTE) pre-computes constants like C++ constexpr.  
  Includes comprehensive tests and assembly comparisons showing optimization impact.  

- **[Black Hole Simulation](https://github.com/DriftCastSam/Blackhole)**  
  Real-time 2D particle simulation of a blackhole with Newtonian gravity and collision physics.  
  Built with C++ and OpenGL, handles ~1500 particles using spatial hashing for efficient collision detection.  
  Includes UI controls for spawning patterns, time scaling, and interactive camera zoom.

### In Progress

- **Wind Tunnel Embedded System**  
  Real-time embedded system for **sensor acquisition, validation, and closed-loop control**.  
  Emphasis on **hardware interfacing, deterministic timing, and fault handling**.  
  Developed as part of a **Master’s thesis at UQAR**.

### Technical Stack

- **Languages:** C, C++, x86-32 Assembly, Python  
- **Domains:** real-time systems, hardware architecture, game engines, graphics, embedded systems
