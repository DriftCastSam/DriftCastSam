## Samuel Frappier-Fortin

Systems-oriented developer focused on **game engines, real-time systems, and embedded software**.  
Primary interests are **performance, memory behavior, and deterministic execution**.  
I learn by **building complete systems end-to-end** and validating them under real constraints.

### Core Focus

- C++ design and low-level architecture
- Engine-level systems and tooling
- Embedded and hardware-adjacent software
- Concurrency, data flow, and timing guarantees

---

### Featured Projects

- **[Minimal Compiler](https://github.com/DriftCastSam/Compiler)**  
  A small compiler implementing **lexing, parsing, IR construction, and code generation**.  
  Designed to emphasize **correctness, explicit structure, and traceable transformations**.  
  Built to understand the full compilation pipeline rather than isolated components.

- **[Navigable Black Hole Simulation](https://github.com/DriftCastSam/Blackhole)**  
  Real-time C++ / OpenGL simulation with **interactive navigation**.  
  Uses **multi-threaded physics**, with a clear separation between **simulation and rendering**.  
  Focuses on **data-oriented design, concurrency, and real-time constraints**.

### In Progress

- **Wind Tunnel Embedded System**  
  Real-time embedded system for **sensor acquisition, validation, and closed-loop control**.  
  Emphasis on **hardware interfacing, deterministic timing, and fault handling**.  
  Developed as part of a **Master’s thesis at UQAR**.

### Technical Stack

- **Languages:** C, C++, x86-32 Assembly, Python  
- **Domains:** real-time systems, hardware architecture, game engines, graphics, embedded systems
