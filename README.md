## Samuel Frappier-Fortin

Systems-oriented student working on **game engines, real-time systems, and embedded software**.  
I focus on **performance, memory, and predictable behavior**. I learn best by building and testing systems end-to-end.

### Focus Areas

- C++ design and architecture
- Engine-level and tooling code
- Embedded and hardware-adjacent software

---

### Featured Projects

- **[Simple Compiler](link)**  
  Minimal compiler demonstrating parsing, IR, and code generation.  
  Focus on **correctness, clear structure, and traceable transformations**.
  Used to learn the pipeline of compiling.

### In Progress

- **Navigable Black Hole Simulation (C++ / OpenGL)**  
  Interactive simulation with **multi-threaded physics** and real-time rendering.  
  Emphasis on **data flow, simulation-render separation, and concurrency**.

- **Wind Tunnel Embedded System**  
  Real-time embedded system for **sensor acquisition, validation, and control**.  
  Focus on **hardware interfacing, timing guarantees, and reliability**.
  Part of a **master’s thesis at UQAR**.
